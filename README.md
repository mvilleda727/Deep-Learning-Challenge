Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? IS_SUCCESSFUL
What variable(s) are the features for your model?APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? EIN, NAME
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? The models target perfomance was difficult to achieve. Pinpointing the issue was one of the concerns.
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? Re checking scripts, data and ensuring everything is running as it should.
